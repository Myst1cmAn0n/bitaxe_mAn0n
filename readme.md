# The bitaxeSupra
bitaxe is a fully open source hardware Bitcoin ASIC miner. Supra is the 4th major revision of the bitaxe that now includes the BM1368 ASIC from the Antminer S21

throu## All the same shit as Supra

This fork is to experiment with cooling the ASIC from the ground plane, directly underneath the ground pad of the asic.  This is in addition to the normal fan cooling.  Components are moved to clear an exposed copper surface, 1"x1".  That surface will be thermal interface to a heatsink through an indium shim.  Experiment is to see if additional thermal dissipation allows for sustained hashrates greater than the standard supra/bitaxe configuration.  If first iteration shows promise, will look to boards with 8 and 16 ASIC configurations
